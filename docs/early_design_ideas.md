# Early Design Ideas and Planning Log

This document captures the initial design conversations, architectural decisions, and feature planning for the Geekworm X1201/X120X UPS monitoring project for Raspberry Pi 5 and Linux.

## Summary
- Goal: To create the most comprehensive, user-friendly, and extensible UPS monitoring and battery management dashboard available for the Geekworm X1201/X120X series.
- Why: No existing open-source solution offers this level of monitoring, alerting, analytics, and safety for this hardware.

## Key Early Ideas & Decisions
- Modular repo structure (docs, config, src, scripts, tests, service, data)
- YAML-based config and calibration
- User-configurable cell voltage thresholds and runtime logic
- Rich documentation and onboarding for contributors
- Readable LED mapping, event logging, and diagnostic exports
- Support for advanced analytics, future GUI, Docker, and systemd
